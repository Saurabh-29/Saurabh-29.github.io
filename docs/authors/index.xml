      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m currently working, as a Research Software Engineer at Liv.ai, on developing a Deep Learning based Text-to-Speech system for Indian languages. Previously, I graduated from IIT Roorkee, with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering with minors in Computer Science. I have a keen interest in data-driven Machine/Deep Learning research, particularly in the use of deep neural models for Computer Vision and Speech Synthesis tasks. At my home institution, I have primarily worked with Dr. G. K. Pillai. As a Research Intern at Adobe Research Labs, I worked with Dr. Sunav Choudhary on task Design of Algorithm for Federated Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
